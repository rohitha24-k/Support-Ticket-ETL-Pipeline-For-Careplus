## Architecture Overview

This project implements an end-to-end AWS ETL pipeline for customer support analytics, designed to create a **single source of truth** by processing both structured ticket data and unstructured log data.

### High-Level Architecture Flow

1. **Data Sources**
   - **Structured data:** Support ticket CSV files (ticket ID, agent, priority, resolution time, etc.)
   - **Unstructured data:** Application and support log files

2. **Data Lake (Amazon S3)**
   - Amazon S3 is used as the central data lake.
   - Raw data is stored in separate folders for ticket data and log data.

3. **Log Data Processing (AWS Lambda – Event Driven)**
   - An S3 event trigger is configured on the raw log files folder.
   - Whenever a new log file is uploaded to S3, an AWS Lambda function is automatically triggered.
   - The Lambda function:
     - Reads and parses unstructured log files
     - Performs lightweight transformations
     - Converts log data into **Parquet format**
   - The processed Parquet files are stored in a curated S3 folder.

4. **Ticket Data Transformation (AWS Glue – Batch Processing)**
   - Structured ticket CSV files are processed using AWS Glue jobs.
   - Glue performs data cleaning, schema normalization, and enrichment.
   - AWS Glue Data Catalog is used to manage metadata and table definitions.
   - Transformed ticket data is written back to S3 in analytics-ready format.

5. **Ad-Hoc Analysis (Amazon Athena)**
   - Amazon Athena is used to query both ticket and log data directly from S3.
   - Enables quick validation and exploratory analysis using SQL.

6. **Data Warehouse (Amazon Redshift)**
   - Cleaned and transformed ticket and log data is loaded into Amazon Redshift.
   - Redshift acts as the **centralized data warehouse** and **single source of truth**.

7. **Analytics & Reporting (Power BI)**
   - Power BI connects to Amazon Redshift for reporting.
   - Dashboards provide insights into ticket volume, resolution time, SLA compliance, and agent performance.

### Key Benefits of This Architecture
- Event-driven processing for log data using AWS Lambda
- Scalable batch transformations for ticket data using AWS Glue
- Centralized and consistent reporting from a single source of truth
- Reduced manual effort with near real-time analytics
